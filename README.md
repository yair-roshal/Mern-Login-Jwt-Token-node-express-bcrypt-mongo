# mern-login


Weâ€™ll be creating a minimal full-stack login/authorization app using the MERN stack (MongoDB for our database, Express and Node for our backend, and React for our frontend).

npm i -This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on
We must run twice. In the shared folder (server) and in the client folder (Client)

npm start - start of the client
npm run dev (nodemon server.js) - start of the server
